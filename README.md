# EcoTrack - Carbon Footprint Tracker

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

EcoTrack is an platform designed to help individuals and businesses track, analyze, and reduce their carbon footprint in real-time. By integrating data from daily activities, purchases, and energy usage, EcoTrack provides personalized recommendations to promote sustainable living and operational efficiency.


## Background

Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges of our time, with carbon emissions being a significant contributor. While many people and organizations want to reduce their environmental impact, they often lack the tools to measure and understand their carbon footprint effectively.

·	Problem: There is no easy, automated way for individuals or small businesses to track their carbon emissions comprehensively.
·	Frequency: This is a global issue affecting billions of people and millions of businesses daily.
·	Personal Motivation: As someone passionate about sustainability, I want to empower people to make informed decisions that benefit the planet.
·	Importance: Reducing carbon emissions is critical to mitigating climate change, and awareness is the first step toward action.

## How is it used?

·	Context: EcoTrack would be used by individuals, households, and small businesses to monitor their environmental impact.
·	Users:
  ·	Individuals: Track daily activities like commuting, shopping, and energy use.
  ·	Businesses: Monitor supply chain emissions and office energy consumption.
·	Impact: Users gain insights into their carbon footprint and receive actionable recommendations to reduce it.


## Data sources and AI methods

  1.	User-input data (e.g., transportation habits, energy usage, dietary preferences).
  2.	APIs from services like utility providers, e-commerce platforms, and transportation apps.
  3.	Public datasets on carbon emissions for products, services, and activities.

## Challenges

  1.	Data Accuracy: Reliance on user-input data may lead to inaccuracies.
  2.	Scope Limitations: The tool may not account for all indirect emissions (e.g., embedded carbon in products).
  3.	Adoption: Encouraging users to consistently input data and follow recommendations may be difficult.

## What next?

  1.	Expand Data Sources: Partner with companies to integrate real-time data from smart devices, apps, and IoT sensors.
  2.	Gamification: Add features like challenges, rewards, and social sharing to encourage sustainable behavior.
  3.	Policy Integration: Work with governments to provide carbon credits or incentives based on EcoTrack usage.
  4.	Global Scale: Localize the platform for different regions, accounting for varying carbon emission factors.
